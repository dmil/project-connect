        <h3>Context</h3>
          <p> Project Connect has gained significant attention since the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result, there has been a growing amount of financial support and donations to the project. Currently, there are over 50 countries where connectivity is underway through the taskforce. Therefore, team members are faced with the question of “how best to allocate the money across all the available countries”. There is currently no systemic way to address the question. The WIP methodology presented on this website provides a tool that can be a first catalyst to the development of a standardized framework for supporting more efficient, effective and optimal deployment of funding to school internet connectivity.</p>

        <h3>Methodology</h3>
            <p> Methodology for Need Based Scoring and Preparedness Based Scoring:
            The scoring is derived from a weighted average of points assigned to need, ICT infrastructure and corruption parameters. </p> 

            <p>Need Based Scoring: The composite scoring is a weighted average of Need, ICT and Corruption parameters. 50% weight is assigned to Need, and 25% each to ICT Infrastructure and Corruption. The points assigned to each country vary from 1 to 9. For the Need parameter, the country that has the least number of schools covered by internet is assigned 9 points and the best performing is assigned 1 point. For the ICT infrastructure, the country with the worst infrastructure is assigned 9 points and the country with worst corruption is assigned 9 points as well.</p>

            <p>Preparedness Based Scoring :The composite scoring is a weighted average of Need, ICT and Corruption parameters. In this, 15% weight is assigned to Need, 50% to Infrastructure and 35% to Corruption. The weights assigned here are different from those in the Need Based Scoring. This is because, this because the disbursement of money under this gives importance to ICT infrastrucutre and Corruption as compared to Need.</p>

            <p>Sourcing for Parameters: The Need paramenter is sourced from index available at this <a href="https://projectconnect.unicef.org/map">link</a> . The Corruption parameter is sourced from Transparency International's link available <a href="https://www.transparency.org/en/countries/afghanistan?redirected=1"> here</a>  and the ICT Infrastructe is sourced from ITU's 2017 index available <a href="https://www.itu.int/en/ITU-D/Statistics/Pages/publications/mis2017/methodology.aspx"> here </a></p>


            <p>ICT Infrastucture Index: 
            The ICT Infrastrucutre Index is sourced from the ITU's ICT Development Index. The ITU 2017 ICT index does not account for Sierra Leon, South Sudan and Niger. These countries account for the neediest coutnries. For calculating the missing index the indicators and sub-indices for each country were put together and the scores were calculated according to the ICT methodology given below. We took data from the nearest available year for certain parameters for which the data from 2017 is not available. </p>

    <h3>Recommendations</h3>

    <p>The 9 countries from UNICEF's list of prioritised countries have less than 50% of schools connected to the internet. Further, the score has been <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vRm4GkQCmVyt7ZMaXtrXRBHR-Yu0f8lsJZpKXp5nT24Er-qjdTX9g9pYCXOjrAYUkvxYlJc8C2P6yMP/pubhtml?gid=768012199&single=true"> developed</a> such that a score of 9 indicates worst performance on each of the three metrics. Based on this scoring system, Sudan and South Sudan, as of today, have the:
                <ol>
                    <li> Lowest proportion of schools connected to the internet</li>
                    <li> The worst preparedness in terms of ranking lowest on the ICT Develoment Index</li>
                    <li> The most stifling political environment rife with corruption</li>
                </ol>
            </p>

    <h3>Limitations</h3>
        <p> Given the lack of time, our metric has several limitations listed below:
                <ol>
                    <li> The choice of 9 from UNICEF's list of prioritised countries was based on those countries with less than 50% of schools connected to the internet.</li>
                    <li> The lack of data for Sierra Leone, South Sudan and Niger made it necessary for us to impute ICT index values using proxies for each.</li>
                    <li> The ICT development index is based on figures from 2017.</li>
                    <li> The Corruption index may not include internet shutdowns which is of specific importance to our context.</li>
                    <li> We have assigned weights of .5, .25 and .25 to the proxies for need, infrastructure and government. However, these are arbitrary and need to be looked into further.</li>
